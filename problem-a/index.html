        <p>Gojo is a character from the anime/manga series <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jujutsu_Kaisen">Jujutsu Kaisen</a>.</p>
        <p>He is a sorcerer who is regarded as one of the strongest in the world.</p>
        <p>He is also a silly and goofy guy who likes to joke around with others.</p>
        <p>Here are a few reasons why I like him:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>He's powerful</li>
            <li>He's funny</li>
            <li class="important">He's beautiful</li>
        </ul>
